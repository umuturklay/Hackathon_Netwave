# Hackathon_Netwave
AI car crash assistant for future integration. (ps. we came 3rd in the competition)

//Every ambulance call sends an sms to Eren's phone so don't abuse it (I'll push with my phone soon)

//After the hardware detects a crash, AI assistant activates. Our working scenario starts right after the crash.

//Assistant keeps generating questions based on your answers. If you ask her to call ambulance it does.
//If you talk like you have no problems but you give answers that are irrevelant from the context it infers that you have a concussion and calls an ambulance.

//If you say you are fine and you give consistent answers to her questions she starts to ask questions about your car.
//Then based on your inputs it calls a tow truck to your location. 

//Location services don't work on daily basis as they are paid services. But it did work correctly once we start the trial.
